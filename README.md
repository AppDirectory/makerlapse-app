### Makerlapse

Makerlapse is a cross paltform that take screenshots of your full screen or a specific window and convert all screenshots taken in a video and you can add a soundtrack . In a couple of clicks ,you have  ready made timelapse video of your work to share with your friends or clients


### Features
- Light files: We don't record a full length video and then speed it up â€“ instead, we record directly a time-lapse video. This means no heavy files on your hard drive and quicker exporting process.

- Simple UI: We provide easy & clean UI with only necessary elements, with one click you can get time-lapse video ready in couple of seconds

- Add your own soundtrack: You can upload your own soundtack. So, you'll have a ready made timelapse video to share
- Cross-platform: You can use it both on Windows and Mac OS


## About Me

I'm a self-taught developer and I love watching speed coding videos and see how things are built-in timelapse video effects and I was inspired by Devon Crawford Video which he makes a script to automate his video editing process and it's built it with C and FFmpeg after that I come up with idea for cross-platform desktop app using Node js and FFmpeg 

I built Marketplace to document my journey as newbie indie maker and self-taught developer for my #12SideProjectsIn3Months Challenge

## Why I build Makerlapse?
When I started my indie making journey, I was working on my first app idea and I was reading a lot of articles about indie making from the IH interviews, posts, and also listening to the podcast. I read a post about building in public and the advantages from it and they're many ways to build in public (Live coding, share your daily todos and progress in Twitter)

I found an idea to document my journey while building an app and share it in a time-lapse video format

Also, I'm working on building a community to share your Makerlapse video with other like-minded people (for example junior developers who want to start #100daysofcode challenge and document their journey )

## What the current status of Makerlapse?
I was working on improving it the last couple of weeks but in the last two days, I was rebuilding it (from recording your screen in video format to just screenshots) and I think the app is ready for early adopters but the Mac OS Catalina isn't supported yet
